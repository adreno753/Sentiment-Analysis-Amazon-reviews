Loan Approval Prediction: Machine Learning Pipeline
This project focuses on predicting loan approvals based on applicant information using machine learning techniques. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building to deliver accurate predictions.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
Feature Engineering: Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Modeling: Train multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Results
The Random Forest model achieved the best performance, with Credit_History and LoanAmount as the most important features influencing loan approval decisions.

Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy
